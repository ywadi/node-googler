It does NOT use the Google Search API. PLEASE DO NOT ABUSE THIS. The intent of using this is convenience vs the cruft that exists in the Google Search API.\n\nThis is not sponsored, supported, or affiliated with Google Inc.\n\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n    npm install [-g] google\n\n\n\nAPI Example\n-------\n\nThis prints out the first 50 search results of the query `node.js best practices`.\n\n```javascript\nvar google = require('google');\n\ngoogle.resultsPerPage = 25;\nvar nextCounter = 0;\n\ngoogle('node.js best practices', function(err, next, links){\n  if (err) console.error(err);\n  \t\n  for (var i = 0; i < links.length; ++i) {\n    console.log(links[i].title + ' - ' + links[i].link); //link.href is an alias for link.link\n    console.log(links[i].description + \"\\n\");\n  }\n\n  if (nextCounter < 4) {\n    nextCounter += 1;\n    if (next) next();\n  }\n\n});\n```\n\n\n\nCLI\n---\n\nYou can use the `google` package as a command line program as well. Just specify the `-g` flag when installing. The command line version outputs CSV data in the following format:\n\n    \"{{HREF}}\",\"{{TITLE}}\",\"{{DESCRIPTION}}\"\n\n### Usage\n\n    \n    Usage: google [options]\n\n    Options:\n\n      -h, --help                    output usage information\n      -V, --version                 output the version number\n      -q, --query <query>           Search query.\n      -p, --pages [num]             Number of pages to search. defaults to 5\n      -n, --results-per-page [num]  Number of results per page. defaults to 100\n\n\n### Example\n\n    google -q \"node.js best practices\" -p 1 -n 10\n\noutputs...\n\n    \"http://www.slideshare.net/the_undefined/nodejs-best-practices-10428790\",\"Node.js - Best practices\",\"Dec 2, 2011 ...
